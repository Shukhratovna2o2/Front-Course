                I am slowly learning that even if I react, it won't change anything, it won't make people suddenly love
                and respect me, it won't magically change their minds. Sometimes it is beter to just let things be, let people 
                go, do not expect people to understand where you're coming from. I am slowly learning that life is better
                lived when do not center it on what's hapening around you and center it on what's happening inside 
                you instead. work on yourself and your inner peace.

                You can rise up from anything. You can completely recreate yourself. Nothing is permament. You're not stuck. 
                You have choises. You can think new thoughts. you mcan learn something new. you can create new habits. All 
                that matters is that you mdecid today and never look back.

                Do these answers surprise you? At one time in our culture, the most common answer probably would have had something to do with two parents, one mom and one dad, and children. Most likely biological. What do you notice when you read that? There’s something missing, isn’t there? I think so too. Not only does this definition leave out so many people, but it also strictly defines how a family is structured and created.

                       When I began my training in Marriage and Family Therapy back in 2010, my definition of family had a specific focus on biology. Not only did my definition include my parents and siblings, but also extended family members. As I learned more about family systems and how it truly takes a village to raise children and support people, particularly related to mental health, my definition slowly started to change. For example, I provided In-home skills and therapy services during my practicum. This experience opened my eyes to a world I was unfamiliar with. I worked with single parent families, families whose caregivers were Grandparents, adopted families, same-sex caregiver families, and families who considered their neighbors closer than aunts and uncles. I even came to a realization that families do not have to include children at all, and might have a heavy focus on pets!
