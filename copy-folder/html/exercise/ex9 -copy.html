        And when you are now alone... believing in yourself, you will act alone to your goel and strive 
        with all your might to achieve your goal of success and get the result that you are capable of and 
        what you really deserve...
        Be yourself and alone on your way and be alone with your thoughts and never lose heart, just relax, everthing 
        will be fine, even better than you expected..
        Once someone told me one unusual phrase... Spit on the motivation and words of others when its goals and aspiration
        you don't have inside yourself because the motivation of others is too temporary and what you have inside will 
        remain only with you... 
    </small><br>
    When you're almost to your goal, you just can't believe that you were able to do all these emotions, all these feelings and difficulties, 
    and when there are only 7 months left, you start to worry from the inside that you really could?...
